**RoutineHub Community Updates**

Hello RoutineHub Community, 

Lots of strong updates, so let's get started. 

**Part 1 of 4 -** **Bug Fixes**

1. Broken link after selecting "Forgot Password" User selects link "Forgot Password", submit their email, receive a reset password email with a broken link. **Fixed**

2. Incorrect Password Error - A website error occurs when a user submits an incorrect password during log-in. **Fixed**

3. Inconsistent Log In Log Out - Members noticed session inconsistencies while logging in. **Fixed**

**Part 2 of 4 - Process Improvements**

**Better Protocol for Reporting Takedown Requests**

If you report a shortcut due to a policy violation, we now have a better process for managing them. This does not mean that every shortcut you report will be removed, but it does mean that we have a better system for capturing your submissions and verifying your assertion.  

Thank you <@355492101758255116> for your input [here](https://discord.com/channels/503976650439131183/504063013515427851/1025931452312981614)

**Part 3 of 4 - We Now Have Two Task Forces**

We have two active task forces helping us a) curate the best shortcuts created by the community and b) remove low-quality shortcuts. 
 

**Quality & Integrity Task Force**

Per my previous announcement, <@986735824982904882>  and <@438277346487697418>  have begun a task force dedicated to removing low-quality shortcuts on the site. 

Phase 1 consisted of removing low-quality shortcuts, and within that category, the team decided to organize "Low Quality" into tiers (Squirrel Thought: I prefer the word "Tranche" more than Tier but whatever, I digress.).

Tier0 was focused on identifying and removing shortcuts that pattern match "test,"/test/, /(test)/. You get the picture. The group reviewed a sample of 300 shortcuts and identified 21% for removal. Great!

Here is <@986735824982904882> [announcement from yesterday](https://discord.com/channels/503976650439131183/504063013515427851/1027608343117840464)

Now, if you're like me, you have got to believe that there are way more placeholder shortcuts with the title "test" in them. If you agree, please read on.

**Part 4 of 4 - We Need Your Help**

This community is incredible at solving problems. I see you do it daily on this Discord group so if you're ready to help, please ping <@986735824982904882> or <@438277346487697418> to join the Shortcut Quality & Integrity task force. Reach out <@986735824982904882> to join the <#1000149774722416760> Together, we can deliver a better platform for the community to enjoy. 

**Other Ways to Help**
If you're busy but you like the community, here are a few other things you can consider. 

1. Submit a shortcut you like to <#504120881119887371> . RoutineHub is the largest community of shortcut badasses who know how to build and therefore know what a well-made script is. If you think something is good, share it with us. If you made it and you think it's good, share it. If you're concerned about looking like a braggart, don't. 

2. Boost our Server. This Discord is all about community, and if members believe that the team and I are making strong efforts to make improvements, show your support and submit a boost.
