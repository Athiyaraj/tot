Tot 1.1.1

All:

• Improved Markdown support:

  - Underscores and asterisks in rich text are now escaped when converted to Markdown.
  - Text for inline links is handled correctly now.
  - Improved handling of horizontal rulers.

macOS:

• The icon picker in Settings is a lot simpler now. We’re not afraid to make mistakes, we’re afraid of bad decisions that don’t get corrected. :-)
• Added icons that look better on future versions of macOS.
• Titlebar appearance was adapted for future versions of macOS.
• Pasting relative URLs now treats them as plain text. [Yay Marvin!]
• Fixed selecting fixed width fonts by not using a localized name. [Yay Carles!]
• Fixed issues with substitutions and text checking getting stored and synced correctly. [Yay Dom!]

iOS:

• Added entitlement for “user installed fonts” so Adobe CC fonts can be used.
• Change sharing extension button from “Done” to “Save”.
• Fixed issues with keys when reduced transparency was turned on. [Yay Oli!]
• Typing whitespace at the end of a link will remove link formatting and allow normal text to be entered. [Yay Gruber!]
