Tot 1.2.1

All:

• Dot defragger: compacts dots to keep things clean and organized:
  - Cleans up dots by moving full ones to the left and empty ones to the right
  - iOS: Use “Compact Dots” in share sheet (or tap & hold on share icon)
  - macOS: Use Window > Compact Dots… (or ⇧⌘D)
• AutoList will only remove bullets if they are in the middle of a list [Thanks Ian!]
• Fixed check for 100,000 characters: deleting text no longer triggers the alert
• If the first paragraph of a dot is mostly Arabic or Hebrew, the text will automatically switch to using a Right-to-Left writing direction [Thanks Ezra!]
• In plain text, ⌘B and ⌘I inserts a single Markdown character without a selection (this previously only worked with selected text)


macOS:

• New symbol picker added to status bar:
  - Click on the asterisk to get a popover with symbols
  - Pick a bullet to start a new list, Emoji to add status, or any other symbol
  - A quick alternative to ⌃⌘Spacebar


iOS:

• Fixed sample text at first launch
