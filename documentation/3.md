**Your text is saved automatically and synced to iCloud.**

_Everything_ you enter is captured as soon as you stop typing and is then available from the network. If you use more than one Mac, for example at home and work, your notes are wherever you are! Even better, there’s an [app for iOS](https://tot.rocks) that lets you access everything from your pocket!

Tot’s text is easy to get at: the window appears any time you click on the _Dock_ icon. Use the keyboard to select a view with ⌘1 to ⌘7, then ⌘W or Escape when you’re done. There’s even a configurable keyboard shortcut to display the window: your hands never have to leave the keys!

You _never_ have to save, although you’ll find that’s a hard habit to give up: ⌘S syncs immediately with visual feedback. If you need all or part of your text in a file, use _Save As_ in the _File_ menu (or ⇧⌘S.)
