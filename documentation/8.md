Tot got its start with a simple goal: something like [tyke](https://tyke.app/), but with multiple editors in a window that could be dragged away from the menu bar.

Once that was working, I showed it to some friends and several asked for rich text in addition to plain text. It occurred to me that using a subset of Markdown could achieve that, and be pretty darn useful for the kinds of things I did with Tot.

After a bunch of typing and sweating over design details, we now have a tool thatâ€™s indispensible. We hope you like it, too.
