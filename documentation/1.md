**Welcome to Tot!**

Tot is a simple app that lets you _collect & edit_ text.

Tot uses a single window to hold seven individual text documents. Simply click on the colored dots at the top of the window to switch between documents.

(If you're colorblind, make sure the “differentiate without color” setting is turned on in Accessibility settings and the dots will be numbered instead..)

_Click on the arrow below_ to continue to the next section.
