Plain Text
==========

Tot also allows you to work with plain text. Click on the “a” icon at the bottom of the window to toggle between the styled and plain views. Like TextEdit, a ⇧⌘T works, too.

If you’re familiar with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), Tot’s syntax will be familiar for things like **bold text** or adding _emphasis_.

Tot is _not_ a full Markdown editor, and never will be. It uses a subset that’s easy to understand and efficient at storing the popular features of rich text. RTF and HTML are more expressive, but have unneeded complexity for the simple tasks performed here.

Similarly, Tot isn’t an image editor, yet you can do this:

                 (  )
                 (oo)
          .-------\/ --- Tot is udderly fantastic.
         / |     ||
        *  ||w---||
           ^^    ^^

Plain text is also where Tot’s limited formatting starts to shine: select some words and use ⌘I or ⌘B. Constraints can be powerful.
