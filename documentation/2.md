**Use Tot for many tasks.**

Tot can be used for to-do lists, notes, brainstorming, and more. We’ve used Tot to keep track of release notes, for doing research on new projects, starting blog posts, creating this tutorial, and anything else that requires typing without much friction.

The formatting is purposefully simple: there’s only _italic_ and **bold** (with ⌘I and ⌘B keyboard shortcuts). The text is displayed in just one font (which you can customize). With Tot, the most important thing is the content, not how it looks. As you’ll see in a bit, these formatting limitations also provide powerful capabilities.

Keyboard shortcuts work just as you’d expect, even the more obscure ones like ⌃A and ⌃E to move to the start and end of a paragraph.
