**Tot loves links.**

Whether you’re in plain text or rich text, Tot handles links intelligently. If you drag a link from a web browser, you’ll get the page title and URL formatted as rich text or as Markdown inline link. In plain text mode, it’s easy to edit the parts individually; rich text gives you a clickable link.

This conversion also happens if you copy and paste a block of text from a web page: text and links are converted on the fly. If you’re entering URLs manually, they’ll automatically be detected as you type.

Links aren’t limited to just web pages. [Click here](dict://tot) to see "tot" in the dictionary. Here are other useful examples:

<x-bbedit://open?url=file:///etc/hosts>
<facetime:18005551212>
<tel:1-800-555-1212>
<ssh://root@example.com>

Try dragging a message from Mail into Tot’s window: you will get [a link](https://daringfireball.net/2007/12/message_urls_leopard_mail) that’s a simple way to reference conversations and other information!

**Take a shortcut.**

Tot fully supports [Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) on both macOS and iOS. There are actions to get, set, and show text from any dot. You can also query a dot to get more advanced information, like text counts, the modification date, JSON representations, and more.

These features turn Tot into a great scratchpad for automation, and with support for both platforms, your workflows work anywhere.
