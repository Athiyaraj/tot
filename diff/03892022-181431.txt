I was delighted to discover by way of the macOS Beta that shortcuts actions are coming to [Tot](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot/id1491071483) and [Tot Pocket](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot-pocket/id1498235191)!

From the Tot version 1.3 Testflight notes:

> • Added support for Shortcuts:
> - Commands to get, set, or show text from any dot
> - Works great as scratchpad to collect input for a Shortcut
> - Also a convenient way to save text that has been processed
> - Same actions on macOS and iOS, allowing shared workflows

I would like to say thanks to /u/Aprilhoomie and /u/Neskire for posting useful information at <https://redd.it/jecdyn>

I wanted to write a summary how I work out with torrenting on iOS, here is my approach.

First you will need iSH Shell app from <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ish-shell/id1436902243>

Second, you will need to have a way to view page source to copy the “magnet:” magnet link address, because apparently somehow we couldn’t simply copy the magnet address as link without special workarounds, it could very well be Apple imposing this limitation.

I have the text editor I developed with Shortcuts I can use to view page source, if you’re interested:

	Have Shortcuts app installed, then grab New Text (and Save Text if you want save support) from <https://redd.it/ho37cs>

	If it said this shortcut is untrusted: Settings app > Shortcuts > Allow untrusted shortcuts

	If grayed out: Open Shortcuts app, create a random shortcut, the button will become available afterwards

	Visit a webpage, open share sheet and choose New Text, your clipboard will be updated, paste into the text editor, then use Safari’s address to find “magnet:” in the page. For difficult magnet link, try select around it on the normal page then open New Text, the source will shrink to there.

Finally open iSH, type and enter

first time:

	apk add –upgrade transmission-cli

every session (to enable running torrent in background for this session):

	cat /dev/location > /dev/null &

every torrent:

	transmission-cli (paste magnet link)

So you know, you can use Files app to access recently torrented files in /root/Downloads/

That’s it!




UPDATE 2022/01/15 (bit late but never too late): way to stop seeding upon completion. Create a kill file into /root/ dir containing

	#!/bin/sh

	killall transmission-cli

Open iSH, type and enter to change permission for the kill file

	chmod +x /root/kill

Then for next torrent do this

	transmission-cli -f /root/kill (paste magnet link)

**I'm David Blue - an automotive journalist on sabbatical and self-described _Software Historian_.**

It's good to be here!

By that I mean, it's especially nice to feel welcome here even though **I am in no way a software developer**.

I use the term _Software Historian_ because I have found myself especially fascinated with the origin stories of the platforms and services we use in the past 3-4 years, especially regarding Word Processors.

My _ultimate_ software development aspiration would be to build my own CMS with Python from scratch, but I'm not just being humble when I tell you that I am _very_ far away from doing that.

Recently, I have been toying with the idea of writing a _Literary History of Streaming Music_, directly inspired by Professor Matthew G. Kirschenbaum's _[Track Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674417076)_, continuing the work I began in one of my all-time best essays **[examining the Holiness of Bandcamp](https://davidblue.wtf/essays/bandcamp)** as a technology company who can do no wrong.

I'm sure anyone reading this can relate when I lament that _I really should get around to writing an updated bio_, but I've already spent enough time on this one, I think. Let me just _quote myself_ from my blog's about page:

_I’ve already born witness to innovation bridging divisions between people throughout the greatest informational renaissance my species has ever seen... Originally, I wrote about our relationship with **cars** ([2019 Volkswagen Atlas Review](https://dieselgoth.com/2019-volkswagen-atlas-sel-vr6-review)) and now **technology** ([Bandcamp: Streaming's Secret Savior](https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music)) from a perspective that feels tedious or abstract to some, but is generally entertaining, through-and-through. I’m proud of the work I’ve done so far, which has been wild, absurd, reflective, and hilarious — occasionally all in the same work as I develop my voice._

I'm not just horsing around when I say **feel free to <email me> about literally anything**.
